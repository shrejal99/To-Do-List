# To-Do-List Using JavaScript

A very basic ToDo List Application for all the Android Enthusiasts !

This application allows to create lists of tasks which can be individually managed. Each list contains a set of tasks. Each task can have a deadline, a reminder time and a list of subtasks. By setting a reminder time the user will be informed by a notification. It is possible to display all tasks in a calendar, to protect the app with a secret pin and to sort and prioritze tasks within a list. Colors indicate the urgency of a task (taking the deadline into account).
